# a summary about you
summary: 'My work has to do with understanding how the tactile sensations created by stimulating the peripheral nerves integrate with the motor system. I am investigating how these artificial tactile sensations are processed by the brain at an intuitive level and how this subconscious processing augments the motor plan that is created when controlling our hands. Currently this is studied through the use of upper limb prostheses, but the applications of this research should help us understand how tactile feedback is used for able bodied individuals as well. The overall goal of my research is to close the disconnect that exists between our understanding of how tactile feedback is felt and how our motor commands descending from our brain are used.'
