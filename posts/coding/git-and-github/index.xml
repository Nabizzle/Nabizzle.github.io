Git aliases, just like SSH aliases I posted about previously or any other aliases are meant to create shortened versions of commands for long or commonly used commands. Many of the aliases below are common and are listed here. Below are the aliases I use day to day.
All calls to create an alias starts with the following command git config â€“global alias. where the shortened command follows the period and then the command to replace follows that after a space.</description></item><item><title>Create a GPG Key</title><link>https://nabizzle.github.io/posts/coding/git-and-github/create-a-gpg-key/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 11:55:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://nabizzle.github.io/posts/coding/git-and-github/create-a-gpg-key/</guid><description>Why Use a GPG Key? The SSH key we made in the previous post was meant to encript your code changes between your local repositories and your remote repositories. A GPG key is similar in that it encrypts and signs your commits in your local repository so that your remote repository can verify that the commits were made by a trusted individual. Like the SSH key, you will have to generate a private and public key and add the public key to your remote repository hosting site of choice.</description></item><item><title>Create an SSH Key</title><link>https://nabizzle.github.io/posts/coding/git-and-github/create-ssh.key/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 10:39:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://nabizzle.github.io/posts/coding/git-and-github/create-ssh.key/</guid><description>Why Use an SSH Key? Without an SSH key, you have to log in and enter a password each time you push changes to GitHub. An SSH key allows you to use a password that you can add to your ssh environment that you only need to enter once when you open the terminal. An SSH key creates a private key on your computer that encripts your commits that are pushed to an online repository.</description></item><item><title>Setting Up Git</title><link>https://nabizzle.github.io/posts/coding/git-and-github/setting-up-git/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 09:51:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://nabizzle.github.io/posts/coding/git-and-github/setting-up-git/</guid><description>This tutorial is based heavily on the one from GitHub
Git Download download the latest version of git.
If you download the windows version, you should also install git bash or a similar terminal to have a terminal to enter commands in. If you would like to work using a GUI, download that now.
I suggest either GitHub desktop or Tortoise Git. The git website also has a list of GUIs.</description></item><item><title>Why Use Git?</title><link>https://nabizzle.github.io/posts/coding/git-and-github/why-use-git/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 22:48:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://nabizzle.github.io/posts/coding/git-and-github/why-use-git/</guid><description>Who Uses Git? Git is a common version control system used in academia and industry to keep track of changes to code either when working individually or on a team. The power of git is its use of a centralized repository that is the main, ground truth of the code and individuals can pull their code from this central repository to make changes and push their local changes to this central repository.</description></item></channel></rss>
